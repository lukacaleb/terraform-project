DEPLOYING 2 EC2 WITH WITH A LOAD BALANCER.
You are required to deploy the following tasks
Set up 2 EC2 instances on AWS (use the free tier instances).
Deploy an Nginx web server on these instances (you are free to use ansible)
Set up an ALB (Application Load balancer) to route requests to your EC2 instances
Make sure that each server displays its own Hostname or IP address. 
You can use any programming language of your choice to display this.
Important points to note:
I should not be able to access your web servers through their respective IP addresses. 
Access must be only via the load balancer
You should define a logical network on the cloud for your servers.
Your EC2 instances must be launched in a private network.
Your Instances should not be assigned public IP addresses.
set up auto scaling.
You must submit a custom domain name (from a domain provider e.g. Route53) or the ALBâ€™s domain name.
